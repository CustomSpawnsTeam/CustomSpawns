Version: 1.9.0
Game Versions: v1.0.0
* Adds compatibility against v1.0.0.
* Seperated Calradia At War and Custom Spawns into two different modules. Calradia At War will now use the Custom Spawns API as any other sub-mod.
* Talking to parties spawning along a main spawn caused the game to crash if no custom dialogue was configured. A default dialogue will now prevent this to happen.
* Party trackers were visible for parties spawning along a main spawn. These will no longer show up.
